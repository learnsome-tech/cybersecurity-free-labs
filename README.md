# Cybersecurity Fundamentals, GRC & Cryptography

**Security Architecture, Risk Assessment, NIST CSF 2.0, AES/RSA PKI & Audit Readiness**

6 modules, 28 lessons: Core Security Principles; Governance, Risk & Compliance; Applied Cryptography & Keys; Data Protection & Privacy; Resilience & Disaster Recovery; Enterprise Strategy & Audit. Beginner level, about 3 hours.

This repository holds the labs of the free lessons of the LearnSome.tech course [Cybersecurity Fundamentals, GRC & Cryptography](https://learnsome.tech/courses/cybersecurity-course): each lab's starter files, a README with the goal, the steps and the expected output, and `./check`, which tests your work the way the site does.

## Start

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/learnsome-tech/cybersecurity-free-labs?quickstart=1)

- **Codespaces:** the badge opens this repository in a dev container with Python 3.14.7, SQLite 3.46.1, Git 2.34 (Ubuntu 22.04's) and OpenSSL 3.5, as in the site's lab sandbox.
- **On your machine:**

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/learnsome-tech/cybersecurity-free-labs.git
  cd cybersecurity-free-labs
  ./check m01l01-02
  ```

  You need Python 3 for `./check`, and for the labs themselves Python 3.14.7, SQLite 3.46.1, Git 2.34 (Ubuntu 22.04's) and OpenSSL 3.5. Other versions mostly work, but only the sandbox's versions are sure to print what the site prints. VS Code's Dev Containers extension builds the same container as Codespaces (x86-64).

## Doing a lab

1. Open the lesson on LearnSome.tech and the lab folder beside it: `labs/<lesson>/<lab>/`. The lab README has the goal, the steps and the expected output.
2. Work in the lab's `starter/` folder.
3. From the repository root, run `./check <lab>` (for example `./check m01l01-02`), or `./check <lesson>` for all labs of a lesson, or `./check --all`. `./check --list` shows every lab and how it is checked.

`./check` runs your starter the way the site's lab sandbox does: in a scratch copy that is its working directory and `HOME`, with `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, `input.txt` on standard input, 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream. It then compares the output with the site's own rules, so a pass here is a pass on the site.

| Check | What `./check` does | Labs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Graded | Runs the program and compares its output with `expected.txt`. | 13 |
| Read along | Nothing to run here: the site shows the listing read-only, and the lab README says honestly what it needs (Docker, a cluster, a cloud account...). | 4 |

## What is published, and what is not

This is the **free edition**: the labs of the course's free lessons, the ones anyone with a free LearnSome.tech account can watch. Each lab's starter is the code the lesson shows on screen. There are no reference solutions, no Pro lessons' labs or expected outputs, no narration and no quiz or exercise answers.

The labs of the Pro lessons are on [the course page](https://learnsome.tech/courses/cybersecurity-course), where LearnSome.tech runs and grades them in its sandbox with a Pro membership. The full labs repository is private and stays private.
